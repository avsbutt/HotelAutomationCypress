Cypress Automation Framework with POM Structure

Project Structure Overview:

Fixtures Folder: Purpose: Stores static data that can be used across tests. Contents: Contains JSON files with data like user details, test data, configuration settings, and other static information required for the tests.

Locators Folder: Purpose: Manages all the selectors (XPaths and CSS selectors) used in the project. Contents: Separate files for each page or component, containing the locators to interact with elements on the web pages. This helps in maintaining the selectors in a centralized location.

Test Cases Folder: Purpose: Contains all the test scripts written to validate the functionality of the application. Contents: Organized based on features or pages, each file containing one or more test cases written in Cypress.

Pages Folder: Purpose: Implements the Page Object Model (POM) by creating classes for each page. Contents: Each class represents a page and contains methods to interact with the page elements and perform actions. This abstracts the test logic from the UI structure.

Utils Folder: Purpose: Contains utility functions and reusable code segments. Contents: Common functions like login, data generators, API calls, and other helper functions. Environment-specific login logic is placed here for reusability across different environments.

Environment Management:

Configuration Files: Purpose: Manages different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Contents: Separate configuration files for each environment, specifying the base URL, credentials, and other environment-specific settings.

Cypress.config.js: Purpose: Stores global configurations and environment settings for Cypress. Contents: Base configuration settings, including environment-specific configurations that are dynamically loaded based on the environment being tested.

Custom Commands: Custom Commands in package.json: Purpose: Defines reusable custom commands that extend Cypressâ€™s default commands. Contents: Custom commands for actions like login, form submissions, data validations, etc., enhancing the reusability and readability of test scripts.
